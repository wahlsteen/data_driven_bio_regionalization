# Data driven bio-regionalization
Electronic Supplemental Materials (ESM) for the paper "Bioregions as heuristics: Data-driven delineation reveals continuous gradients rather than discrete boundaries in national biodiversity"

To run the pipe line: start to download/clone the deposit and arrange a folder structure: 
home__
      |__analysis OUT
      |__metadata
      |__occurrences_ds
      |__OUT
      |__all_my_python_scripts.py

Open the Python scripts in numeric order (start with 1_build_assoc…). Update the folder- and file paths in CONFIG, but be sure not to change the name of specified files. Run each script in numeric order. 
Note: the database of occurrence data (stored in occurrence_ds) is on GitHub just a sample due to very large files. Thus, the output from the pipe line will not exactly as the results in the main paper.
